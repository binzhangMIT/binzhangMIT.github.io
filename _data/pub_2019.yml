- title: "Theory of active chromatin remodeling"
  image: effT.jpg
  description: Using a perturbation theory, we show that the non-equilibrium impact of remodeling enzymes on nucleosome positioning can be well approximated by eective equilibrium models with rescaled temperatures and interactions. Numerical simulations support the accuracy of the theory in predicting both kinetic and steady-state quantities, including the eective temperature and the radial distribution function.

  description:
      Here, we present a generic algorithm to improve the accuracy of coarse-grained IDP models using a diverse set of experimental measurements. We successfully applied the algorithm to derive a transferable force field, which we term as MOFF, for de novo prediction of IDP structures.

  description: We introduce a computational model to simulate chromatin structure and dynamics. Starting from one-dimensional genomics and epigenomics data that are available for hundreds of cell types, this model enables de novo prediction of chromatin structures at five-kilo-base resolution.
